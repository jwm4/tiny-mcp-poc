    "# Some ways to use the Responses API in Llama Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "The development of this notebook was assisted by Google Gemini and Cursor using Claude 4 Sonnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting started, follow the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "First install Llama Stack and all of the other dependencies for this notebook.\n",
    "One way to do that is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First install Python 3.12 or later (do not try this with older versions of Python: it will not work).\n",
    "- Then make a Python virtual environment.\n",
    "- Then within that virtual environment run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once everything is installed, run the Llama Stack server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "llama stack run run.yaml --image-type venv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also run the National Parks Service Model Context Protocol (MCP) server:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python nps_mcp_server.py --transport sse --port 3005\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "See [README_NPS](../README_NPS.md) for more information about this server."

    "## Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we point to the locations of the servers we just started up above.  Also, we provide the model ID for the model we want to use.  The model ID should be one that that is specified in [run.yaml](./run.yaml).  In the [run.yaml](./run.yaml) included here, we have the following models defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `gpt4o` are models from OpenAI.  They will only work if you have OPENAI_API_KEY set in your environment to a [valid OpenAI API key](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936850-where-do-i-find-my-openai-api-key).\n",
    "- `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` is a a model from Meta Llama.  This will only work if you have an API key for the hosted [Llama API](https://www.llama.com/products/llama-api/).\n",
    "- `meta-llama/llama-3-3-70b-instruct` is the same model running on watsonx.ai (which has a somewhat different style for model IDs).  This will only work if you have a WATSONX_API_KEY and WATSONX_PROJECT_ID set (which requires an IBM Cloud account).  You may also need to set WATSONX_BASE_URL set if your watsonx.ai instance is running anywhere other than US South (which is the default).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can't or don't want to get any of those API keys, you can update [run.yaml](./run.yaml) to use [another inference provider](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers/inference/index.html#overview).  Llama Stack includes numerous providers for calling hosted models like the ones above.  It also includes providers to call models that you deploy and run yourself using a model serving capability, e.g., the [vLLM provider](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers/inference/remote_vllm.html) or the [ollama provider](https://llama-stack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/providers/inference/remote_ollama.html)."

    "* Output Item 1 shows that it called the NPS server to list all of that server's tools.\n",
    "* Output Item 2 shows that it then called the `search_parks` tool from that server with arguments `{\"state_code\":\"RI\",\"limit\":5}` and got back a list of 4 national parks in Rhode Island.  Since the limit it specified was 5 and it only got 4, presumably that's all there are in that state.\n",
    "* Output Item 3 shows that it called `get_park_events` with arguments `{\"park_code\": \"blrv\", \"limit\": 5}`.  Notice that the value for `park_code` is the same as the value for `code` in the first output from the `search_parks` tool.  So the model recognized that the `code` field in the output of `search_parks` corresponds to the `park_code` field in the input of `get_park_events`.  It gets back a list of events for that park.\n",

This illustrates one of the advantages of this API and its implementation in Llama Stack: Llama Stack handles all of the coordination between all of these steps and calls the model and to the MCP server.  You could accomplish the same thing using basic \"completions\" API that allow you to specify tools, but it would then be up to you in the client to do all that coordinating."
